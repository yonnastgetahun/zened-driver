## Typography

For the app's typography:
- **Primary Font**: A clean sans-serif like SF Pro (Apple's system font) or Inter
- **Headings**: Medium or Semi-bold weight
- **Body Text**: Regular weight, with generous line spacing for readability
- **Accent Text**: Could use the secondary color for emphasis

## Icon Design Concept

For the app icon, we've chosen a design that embodies mindfulness and focused driving:

### Concept: "Mindful Path"

**Elements:**
1. A simplified road or path that forms a subtle "Z" (for Zened)
2. A circular element representing focus/mindfulness (styled like a zen stone or meditation symbol)
3. The primary calming blue as the dominant color with accents of sage green

**Design Principles:**
- **Simplicity**: Clean lines, minimal elements for quick recognition
- **Balance**: Visually balanced composition for a sense of calm
- **Distinctive**: Unique among driving/navigation apps that often use maps or pins
- **Scalable**: Works well at all sizes required by App Store

### Icon Size Requirements for iOS App Store:
- 1024×1024 pixels (App Store)
- 180×180 pixels (iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus)
